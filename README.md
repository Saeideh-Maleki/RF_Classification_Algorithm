# RF_Classification_Algorithm
This project implements a RF classifier  to perform multi-class classification on a dataset containing four classes: 'Other', 'TRN', 'SOJ', and 'MIS'.  This code is used for spatio-temporal transferability. For example to create map for Dijon 2020 using the training data of Tarbes 2021.
